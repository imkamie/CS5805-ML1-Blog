    "text": "Probability Theory\nProbability: In machine learning, probability is used to quantify uncertainty. It is a measure of the likelihood that a particular event will occur. Probabilities range from 0 (impossible event) to 1 (certain event). In the context of machine learning, probabilities are often associated with outcomes of interest.\nConditional Probability: This is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. In machine learning, understanding conditional probability is crucial, especially in Bayesian methods.\nBayesian Inference: It’s an approach to statistical inference where Bayes’ theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available."

In machine learning, random variables are used to model uncertainty in various processes.\nDiscrete Random Variables: These take on a countable number of distinct values. For example, the outcome of rolling a die is a discrete random variable.\nContinuous Random Variables: These can take any value within a range. Examples include the height of a person or the temperature at a given time."
